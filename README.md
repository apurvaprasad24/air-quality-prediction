Machine Learning based Air Quality Prediction Project
# 🌍 Air Quality Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to predict Air Quality Index (AQI) using historical environmental pollutant data.  
Machine Learning models are applied to analyze patterns in air pollution and generate predictions.
